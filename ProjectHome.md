The M-Lab (go/mlab) project is an open-data, open-source initiative by Google and other companies and educational institutions.  The M-Lab project provides servers and programs for Internet users to measure their broadband performance.  My project aims to expose metrics from the M-Lab data repository through a JSON API so that researchers can quickly analyze high-level broadband behavior.

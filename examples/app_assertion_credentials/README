This is just a tiny program to demonstrate how to issue an authenticated request
to BigQuery from AppEngine.


Requirements.
=============
  AppEngine Python API
      -- https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads

  Google API Client Library & OAuth2 Client
      -- http://code.google.com/p/google-api-python-client


Register your AppEngine account with the BigQuery project.
==========================================================
  1. Determine your AppEngine Service Account Name via the Application Settings
     page (under Administration).  This is an email address.  Look for:

       <your_project_name>@appspot.gserviceaccount.com

  2. Add this account email address to the Team page for your BigQuery project.
     You must enable at least "Can view" access for the following code to work.


Fix the code with your details.
===============================
  1. Set your BigQuery 'PROJECT_ID' and 'TEST_QUERY' in 'main.py'.  The BigQuery
     project ID is listed on the Overview page of your Google API Console.

  2. Set the 'application' target in 'app.yaml' for your AppEngine project.

  3. Upload this code to AppEngine.  It won't work with the 'dev_appserver.py'
     script because AppEngine alone can act as your privileged Service Account.

     Specifically, run:
       enable-app-engine-project .
       appcfg.py update .
